- `mainshort.py` – Cleaner version using a subtraction-based pattern

## 🎮 Game Rules

- Snake drinks Water 🐍 > 💧  
- Water douses Gun 💧 > 🔫  
- Gun kills Snake 🔫 > 🐍

## 💡 Skills Practiced

- Conditional logic
- Use of Python dictionaries
- `random.choice()` for computer moves
- Simplifying logic using mathematical patterns
