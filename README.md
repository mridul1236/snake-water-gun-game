# 🐍 Snake Water Gun Game (Python Mini Project)

This project contains two versions of the classic Snake-Water-Gun game built in Python. It's a fun twist on Rock-Paper-Scissors, helping to practice basic Python concepts.

## 📂 Project Files

- `version1_basic_logic.py` – Full logic written using if-elif blocks  
- `version2_optimized.py` – Cleaner version using a subtraction-based pattern

## 🎮 Game Rules

- Snake drinks Water 🐍 > 💧  
- Water douses Gun 💧 > 🔫  
- Gun kills Snake 🔫 > 🐍

## 💡 Skills Practiced

- Conditional logic
- Use of Python dictionaries
- `random.choice()` for computer moves
- Simplifying logic using mathematical patterns

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repo  
2. Run in terminal using:
```bash
python version1_basic_logic.py
# or
python version2_optimized.py
